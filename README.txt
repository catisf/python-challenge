UoB Bootcamp - Python challenge

This repository is Challenge #3 of the UoB Data Analytics bootcamp. 

It contains:
- A folder for each challenge (PyBank and PyPoll)
- Each folder contains:
	- a 'main.py' file with python code to run the analyses
	- a 'Resources' folder, with a (csv) data file and
	- an 'analysis' folder with a text file with the results from the analysis (created in 'main.py')

Source code:
- the code was all learnt throughout the classes, with exception of the code to get unique candidate numbers which was adapted from here: code from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/get-unique-values-from-a-list-in-python
